 diabetes-prediction-model
 <br>
Diabetes prediction model built with Python and Logistic Regression including data preprocessing and model evaluation
<br>
Project Overview
<br>
This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical features such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure.  
It demonstrates the use of machine learning for healthcare data analysis.
<br>
Tools & Libraries
<br>
 Python
 <br>
 Pandas
 <br>
 NumPy
 <br>
 Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
 <br>
 Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
<br>

 Key Tasks
 <br>
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature selection)
<br>
 Train-test split
 <br>
 Model training and evaluation
 <br>
 Visualizing results

## Outcome
The model predicts diabetes with reasonable accuracy and identifies key contributing factors from the dataset.
